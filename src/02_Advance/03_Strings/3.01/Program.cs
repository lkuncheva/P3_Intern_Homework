/*
    A string is an object of the System.String class and is used to represent sequences of characters (array of chars).

    Strings cannot be modified/changed directly. Instead, when a modifier method is used on a string, a new sting object is created.

    Important String Class Methods:

        Length: Returns the length of the string.
        ToUpper() and ToLower(): Convert the string to lowercase or uppercase.
        Trim(): Removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters from the string.
        Substring(): Returns a substring of the string.
        Replace(): Replaces all occurrences of a specified character or substring with another.
        Split(): Divides a string into an array of substrings based on a divider (character, such as a comma or a space, or substring).
        Contains(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains a specified substring.
        Compare(): Compares two strings and returns an integer indicating their relative order.
        IsNullOrEmpty() and IsNullOrWhiteSpace(): Checks if strings are null, empty, or contain only whitespace.
        IndexOf(): Finds the index of a specified character or substring in the string. 
        Join(): Concatenates the elements of an array into a single string.
        Insert(): Inserts a sub-string in a string at given index.
